Implemented Random Bits Regression(RBR) discussed in the paper by Yi Wang, Yi Li, Momiao Xiong, Li Jin

This method first generates a large number of random binary intermediate/derived features based on the
original input matrix, and then performs regularized linear/logistic regression on those
intermediate/derived features to predict the outcome.
