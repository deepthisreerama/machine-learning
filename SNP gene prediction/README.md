This is a simulated dataset of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data 
containing 29623 SNPs (total features). Amongst all SNPs are 15 causal 
ones which means they and neighboring ones discriminate between case and 
controls while remainder are noise. 

Predicted the labels of 2000 test individuals. Used PCC for feature selection and selected the top 15 features, then used SVM for classification and prediction.
